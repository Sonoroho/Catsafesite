            <h1>Fauna and your cats</h1>
            <p>
                Cats are a common household companion that take up a special place in a lot of our hearts. Wether you
                have one, two, or more,
                cats are wonderful pets to share your home with. What a lot of people don't know however is that a lot
                of commonly beloved plants
                are not safe for cats to be around. The effects they can have on cats (and other pets as well) range
                from an upset stomach to
                sadly death. It's important to know what plants you can have in your home and garden and which ones you
                need to get rid of or keep out of
                reach of your cats. This site will provide examples of a few commonly loved plants that are both safe
                and not safe for your furry housemates.
                There will be links to full lists avaliable as well as a page specifically of what to do in an emergency
                situation if your cats injest or come
                into contact with a dangerous plant.
