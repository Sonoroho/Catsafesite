            <center><h1>Cat safe plants for your home and garden</h1>
            <p>There are so many plants in our world and a large portion of them are wonderful to look at.
                Unfortunately, not all of them
                are safe for our furbabies to ingest or even be around in general. Here are a few commonly loved plants
                that are safe for you
                to have in your home and garden that won't hurt your cats. Bamboo, Strawberry plants, Baby's Breath, and
                Roses are a few
                plants that are safe to have around your kittens. Catnip is another plant that some label as toxic is
                generally considered safe for cats in moderation.
            </p>
